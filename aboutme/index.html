        Hi, my name is Sonja Mihajlov. I believe in life long learning and I use my free time to embrace new knowledge. 
        My favorite hobbies are sewing and knitting clothes, delivering soft skills training sessions and learning how to code.
        I learnt how to sew when I was only 10 years old and I haven't stopped sewing since then. I was probably even younger when 
        I started knitting, thanks to my grandma. In march 2018 I became a soft skills trainer and within one year I have delivered 
        more than 50 training sessions with different topics. My favorite topic is Project Management.
        During highschool I first learnt something about HTML and CSS, but only recently I decided to deepen my knowledge and to
        expand it also to JavaScript, Python and Django framework. I enjoy learning through interactive online platforms.
        I also love to travel, I try to travel abroad at least once per month. So far I have visited only European countries and
        in future I would like to visit other continents as well.
        </p>
